## Purpose of this project
This is my first attempt at web dev and with flutter. I wanted to learn how to set up a server, created a CICD pipeline, and work with flutter in general. I learned a great deal about how the internet works and how to develop an application and I feel that I head reasonable success as the the Workout portion is something that I actively use.

Application is intended for desktop viewing and operation but can work on any platform via the web.
